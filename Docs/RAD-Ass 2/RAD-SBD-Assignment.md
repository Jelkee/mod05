|<p>**security Requirements**</p><p></p>|<p>**Security mechanisms (List down for your application)**</p><p></p>|<p>**Remarks on why you considered these requirements? (in a brief)**</p><p></p>|<p>**Supplement requirements for your application**</p><p>**(user story/Abuse case)**</p><p></p>|**Risk identification/Threat Assessment (at least one risk identification/abuse case)**|<p>**appropriate Security Controls**</p><p></p>|<p>**Tick** ✔**if you have applied the given security controls as suggested in the left column**</p><p></p>|
|Authentication|Registered phone number|For granting only the users in this house can access the smart home, we need to register the accounts with their phone number |<p>*Goal*: The system ensures that the phone numbers exist. </p><p>*Requirement*:To register the application, the users should use their phone numbers. *User story*: “As a user, I can enter my phone number to register. </p><p>*Abuse case*: “As an attacker, I can enter a virtual phone number to register.”</p>|<p>1. You enter a wrong phone number more than 3 times. </p><p>2. You enter the correct phone number but fail to enter the right passcode.</p><p>3. The user enters a phone number which is not  the specified format.</p><p></p>|||
||Password checking|For users to use the app and access their profiles, they need to authenticate with a pin code / password to prevent unauthorized people from accessing the app through the phone of one of the household members|<p>*Goal*: The system verifies that there are no default passwords used by the application or any of its components. </p><p>*Requirement*: To access the application, one should require authentication.  </p><p>*User story*: “As a user, I can sign in the application by using my username/phone number and password” *Abuse case*: As an attacker, I can enter the default passwords to access the application.</p>|<p>1. You enter a wrong password more than 3 times. </p><p>2. You enter a default password.</p><p>3. The length of the password is less than 8 digits.</p>|||
||Token system|When users want to register an account or forget the password, we need to use the token to authenticate.|<p>*Goal*: The system ensures that the SMS code is not simple. </p><p>*Requirement*: The system sends an SMS code to the user that they can use to sign in</p><p>*User story*: “As a user, I can enter my phone number and then enter the code sent to me by the application through SMS to access it. *Abuse case*: “As an attacker, I can enter the simple and stupid SMS code to register an account.</p>|<p>1. The token is too simple, such as 0000,1234 etc.</p><p>2. You enter a wrong SMS token more than three times.</p>|||
||<p>Biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition)</p><p></p>|For some advanced authentication features (Optional; could be used for e.g. adding new users or accessing certain sensitive settings)|<p>*Goal*: The system verifies that the fingerprints and facial data entered are not blurred. </p><p>*Requirement*: To access the application without password, the user should use his/her face to authenticate. </p><p>*User story*: As a user, I want to access the application by fingerprint or face recognition. </p><p>*Abuse story*: As an attacker, I can enter the application by using the photo or model.</p>|<p>1. You enter wrong biometric data more than 3 times. </p><p>2. The biometric data are blurred.</p>|||
|Authorization|<p>Role-based authorization</p><p></p>|The admin can register new members and change the settings, others can only control the different smart home components.|<p>*Goal*: The system requires biometric data before the admin can change settings</p><p>*Requirement*: Regular users can only access the components of the smart system whereas admins can access all settings as well</p><p>*User story*: “As an admin, I can change all settings of the smart home system”.</p><p>*Abuse story*: “As an attacker, I get access to all settings if I manage to get into the admin account”</p>|1. You try to perform an operation to which you’re not authorized twice in a row.|||
|Audit|<p>Protection of log files</p><p></p>|<p>To prevent unauthorized users from getting access to personal information through the log files</p><p></p>|<p>*Goal*: The system ensures that the password used for accessing the log files is not the same as the password the admin uses for their account in the app</p><p>*Requirement*: The admin can access the protected log files with a password</p><p>*User story*: “As an admin, I can enter a password to get access to the log files”</p><p>*Abuse story*: “As an attacker, I can access to all log files if I get hold of the admin password”</p>|1. You try to open a log file without the proper permissions|||
||<p>Encoding of sensitive data (personal identifiable information, passwords, phone numbers, etc)</p><p></p>|To prevent people from getting access to this sensitive data in case of a data breach|<p>*Goal*: The system uses hashing to make it harder for attackers to decipher the encoded data by brute force</p><p>*Requirement*: The system encodes sensitive user data to protect it in case of an attack</p><p>*User story*: “As a user, I can safely enter my data in the app because I know it will be encoded”</p><p>*Abuse story*: “As an attacker, I can use brute force to decipher the encrypted data”</p>|1. You request sensitive data from the server to which you do not have access|||
