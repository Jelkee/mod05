Module 5- Computer Systems (2020-21)
Project

What are your team goals for the project? What do you want to achieve? What skills do you
want to improve or work?
Example:

    To gain knowledge in Python programming and RaspberryPi.
    To develop a product that meets all the requirements.
    To gain a better understanding of the concepts taught in this course by applying them to the
    project
    To improve our teamwork, communication and project management skills.
    To improve our agile development skills with Flexibele Scrum, because it is relevant for projects
    to have efficient meetings and implementing features.
    3. Team Expectations (Mention at least 3 for each of the criteria)
    What do you expect from the team members for the a) Participation, b) Meetings, c)
    Communication, d) Conduct, and e) Conflict
    a) Participation (What is your group planning for team participation?):

Example
As a project team:
-We agree not to miss any meeting unless something is very important.

-We agree to pay attention to each other and give a chance to all the members to speak
and share their views.

-We agree that everyone will make sufficient effort into the project.

-We agree to never miss deadlines, unless the task is impossible within the time limit.

-We agree to make plans when everyone is present or will be notified what the planning
is.

b) Meetings (What is your expectation from the team for the team meetings?):

Example
As a project team:

_- We agree to come to the meetings 5 minutes before the allocated time.

    We agree to prepare ourselves with the ideas, and the tasks to be done before the
    meeting._

-We agree to have at least one meeting per week.

_- We agree to make sure that everyone knows what todo before the next meeting

    We agree to keep the meetings organized so peoplewon’t talk at cross purposes_

c) Communication (How do you communicate with each other? Any rules for
communication?):

Example
As a project team:
-We agree to follow one/two online tools for communication. (Discord,whatsapp)

-We agree to decide a venue and time for the physical meetings.

-We agree to check on all online communications(email, discord and canvas) at least in
the morning./ 3 times a day.

-We agree to be polite with each other while chatting in discord, or speaking in physical
meetings.

-We agree that we all speak the same language for communicating.

d) Individual Accountability (What is your expectation level for each individual in
your team for fulfilling team assignments, tasks, and accomplishing
deadlines?):

Example
As a project team:
-We agree that if a team member does not complete the assigned task in time without

intimating us, this is their responsibility.

-We agree to communicate our to-do tasks within the team, and if possible we send
reminders to each other to have a submission on time.

-We agree that one should inform other members the progress in tasks everyday.

-We agree to let the others know when we encounter difficulties with our tasks so they
can help out if possible

-We agree to finish our tasks well before the deadline so we won’t run into problems with
missed deadlines or last-minute submissions

e)Conduct(Howdoyoufollowthedegreeofprofessionalismwithintheteamand

fails to fulfill expectations?):

Example
As a project team :

-We will be disciplined and honestthroughouttheproject.

- We agree to follow the orange card procedure for a warning to the team member(s).

-We agree to not interrupt each other when they are speaking

-We agree to not get angry at each other during the meetings. If someone hasn’t done
their responsibility we will use the card system instead of getting mad.

Project

f) Conflict (How do you handle or how will you react to team conflicts?):

Example

As a project team:

_- We agree to discuss the entire team the problem and mutually find a solution.

    We agree to discuss the problem with our mentor(s) and project coordinator if we
    couldn't identify the solution._

- We agree to use the card system when the conflictwas caused by one of the group
members not living up to their responsibility

    We agree to let the team members that started theconflict, figure it out with each other
    how to solve the problem before the team will intervene,
    We agree to deal with any minor conflicts as soonas they arise to prevent them from
    growing bigger over time
